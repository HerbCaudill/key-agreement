In [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1281.pdf), Matthew Weidner et al. propose a protocol that provides secure group messaging in decentralized networks that have no central authority.

The reference implementation for these protocols is in Java and can be found here: https://github.com/trvedata/key-agreement

This repo represents my attempt to understand the proposed protocol implementing key elements in TypeScript.
